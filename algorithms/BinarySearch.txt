Binary Search

Searching a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
    - Begin with an interval covering the whole array.
        - If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the inteval, narrow the interval to the lower half
        - Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half.
        - Repeatedly check until the value is found ot the interval is empty.

Code in CPP file.

Time complexity: O(logn)
Mem: O(1), no extra memory used. O(logn) with recursive method.

Using:
    int mid = low + (high - low)/2 avoids bugs with large lists.
